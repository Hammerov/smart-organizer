📝 Project Log: Smart-Organizer
Current State:

Code: organizer.py is updated with pathlib and shutil.

Logic: Successfully implemented the "Dev Challenge" using an if/else block to move unknown file extensions into an "Others" folder.

Status: The script is written, and dummy files were created in a test_files/ directory for testing.

Issues Resolved:

PowerShell Commands: Used New-Item to create test files after touch failed.

Encoding Fix: Resolved a SyntaxError (non-UTF-8 code) by ensuring the script is saved with UTF-8 encoding instead of UTF-16.

Git: Staged the changes and prepared for a final push to GitHub.

Next Steps:

Cleanup: Create a .gitignore to keep test_files/ out of the repository.

CLI Upgrade: Replace input() with the argparse library to allow passing folder paths as command-line arguments (e.g., python organizer.py ./my_folder).

Expansion: Add more categories (Video, Audio) to the EXTENSIONS dictionary.
