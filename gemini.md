# Smart Organizer: Context
This is a Python CLI tool designed to automate file organization.

## 🛠️ Current Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** os, shutil, pathlib

## 🎯 Goal
To create a script that can scan a directory (like Downloads) and automatically move files into folders based on their extension (e.g., .pdf -> Documents, .jpg -> Images).

## 📝 Personal Notes
- The README was recently updated.
- I want to add a "Undo" feature eventually.
